TASK - 2:

The example illustrated below is good, but as the one's who have some basics in programming will mainly focus on the topic, but not the instances explained,hence will automatically skip the part.May be , after giving the definition of an operator we can dive into the main categories in R.

At 2:29, You just gave the title with example's below, instead why dont we give a table with all the operators with an example commands, which will be easy for the listener to read.

At the end, I was waiting, eventhough you included in the beginning,but you did'nt explain the misc variables with an example code.As i have some experience with R programming, espcially in advance R programming(when using loops,functions,etc) these operators are very useful.

I reckon, sharing the code in the description will make the listener lives easy, so instead he can directly navigate to the repository and downlaod all the related files.


1.Yes, I have prior experience in teaching as assistant professor, in Calculus course for the students of NIIT University.So, there my main duty is to explain the concepts briefly to the students separately every thursday, as msot of the people have some fear to ask doubts in the middle of the class, which impacts their scores,hence my responsibility is to teach all the concepts crystal clear in such a way that, they are comfortable with me and my procedures.Also,providing academic support to Professors and other staff with teaching and supervising undergraduate students and providing Professors and Department heads with feedback on student progress.

2. I started my career as a Data scientist a couple of years ago, with an internship at IIM lucknow as data science and analytics intern, then i was a newbie and did'nt have a clear cut idea of what is exactly about, but when i dived into it, i could understand that mathematics, statistics, competetive programming, problrm solving capability, thinking out of the box for solutions(like using ENsemble methods, hybrid technogies,etc) are some of the things a fresher needs to take care of, as data science mainly rotates among the topics mentioned below, and those applications are then extended to machine learning, deep learning, etc. And according to me, patience also plays an important role in this field, as errors more information than the theoritical part ,which means he/she needs to spend more time on 'PRACTICAL' than doing only 'THORY'!
